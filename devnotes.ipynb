"There are two things that make the R type provider tricky:\n",
"\n",
" * When you use R provider via NuGet and the F# compiler references the \n",
"   R provider, it attempts to load it from the location where NuGet puts\n",
"   it. This is typically `packages/RProvider.1.0.8/lib`. This directory\n",
"   does *not* contain `RDotNet.dll` (which is installed in `packages/R.NET.1.3.5/lib/net40`)\n",
"   and so the loading could fail.\n",
"\n",
"   To avoid this, we need to make sure that the assembly that is loaded by\n",
"   the F# compiler (and Visual Studio) does not trigger loading of R.NET\n",
"   immediately - that way, we can setup `AssemblyResolve` event handler\n",
"   and load R.NET assembly from another directory.\n",
"   \n",
" * Connecting to R is not entirely stable and so we do not want to crash the\n",
"   F# compiler (or Visual Studio) when something goes wrong with R. For this \n",
"   reason, we run the type discovery in a separate process and communicate\n",
"   with it via .NET remoting.\n",
"\n",
"Project structure\n",
"-----------------\n",
"\n",
"To solve the two issues outlined above, the project structure looks like this:\n",
"\n",
"\u003cdiv style=\"margin:40px\"\u003e\n",
"\u003cimg src=\"misc/diagram.png\" /\u003e\n",
"\u003c/div\u003e\n",
"\n",
"Things to keep in mind\n",
"----------------------\n",
"\n",
"Here is what you need to know about individual assemblies in the solution:\n",
"\n",
" * `RProvider.Runtime.dll` - this is the assembly that contains most of the \n",
"   interesting runtime functionality (such as initialization of R, interop\n",
"   with R and converters that convert values between F# and R). It also contains\n",
"   helpers (logging, etc.). \n",
"   \n",
"   This assembly references R.NET in its public assemblies and so when it\n",
"   is loaded, .NET needs to be able to load R.NET (i.e. the `AssemblyResolve`\n",
"   event handler needs to be set up).\n",
"\n",
" * `RProvider.dll` - this is the assembly that the user of R provider will \n",
"   reference. It does not contain any useful code - it only contains \n",
"   `TypeProviderAssembly` attribute pointing to the assembly with the actual\n",
"   type provider code. \n",
"   \n",
"   Note that we cannot put the functionality from `RProvider.Runtime.dll` \n",
"   here, because the code needs to be referenced by the other two assemblies\n",
"   (that are compiled before the type provider can be loaded).\n",
"\n",
" * `RProvider.DesignTime.dll` - this is where the type provider code lives.\n",
"   This sets up `AssemblyResolve` event handler and then it generates types\n",
"   (by calling the `RProvider.Server.exe` to do the type discovery).\n",
"\n",
" * `RProvider.Server.exe` - this is started as a stand-alone process that \n",
"   performs type and package discovery in R. It is called by the DesignTime\n",
"   component and restarted automatically. This also needs to setup the \n",
"   `AssemblyResolve` event handler.\n"]
