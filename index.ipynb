"\n",
"\n",
"The F# Type Provider is a mechanism that enables smooth interoperability\n",
"between F# and [R](http://www.r-project.org/). \n",
"The Type Provider discovers R packages that are available \n",
"in your R installation and makes them available as .NET namespaces \n",
"underneath the parent namespace `RProvider`. \n",
"\n",
"The Type Provider makes it possible to use \n",
"all of R capabilities, from the F# interactive environment. \n",
"It enables on-the-fly charting and data analysis using R packages, \n",
"with the added benefit of IntelliSense over R, \n",
"and compile-time type-checking that the R functions you are using exist. \n",
"It allows you to leverage all of .NET libraries,\n",
"as well as F# unique capabilities to access and manipulate data \n",
"from a wide variety of sources via Type Providers.\n",
"\n",
"![RProvider demo within an FSharp script](img/vscode.gif)\n",

"The above example is run through F# interactive (`dotnet fsi`).\n",

"## What are R and F#?\n",
"\n",
"[F#](http://fsharp.org) is a multi-paradigm language \n",
"that supports functional, object and imperative programming, \n",
"with the emphasis on functional-first programming. F# runs on the .NET runtime and is a compiled, \n",
"statically typed language with a strong type system and type inference. \n",
"F# is a general purpose programming language, and is particularly well-suited for scientific/numerical computing.\n",
"\n",
"[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is an Open Source language for statistical computing. \n",
"R offers a wide range of high-quality, community-developed packages, \n",
"covering virtually every area of statistics, econometrics or machine learning. \n",
"It is also famous for its charting capabilities, making it a great tool \n",
"to produce publication-quality graphics. \n",
"R is an interpreted, dynamically typed language that is typically used \n",
"from its GUI, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), or command line interactive environment.\n",
"\n",
"## Using the R Type Provider\n",
"\n",
"RProvider is distributed as a nuget package. After [setting up the pre-requisites (installing .NET 5+, R and setting the R_HOME environment variable](requirements.html), you can use as follows:\n",
"\n",
"In an F# script:\n",
"```fsharp\n",
"#r \"nuget:RProvider\"\n",
"\n",
"open RProvider\n",
"```\n",
"\n",
"To add to a .NET project, from the terminal:\n",
"```\n",
"dotnet add package RProvider\n",
"```\n",
"\n",
"Contributing and copyright\n",
"--------------------------\n",
"\n",
"The project has been originally developed by [BlueMountain Capital](https://www.bluemountaincapital.com/) and contributors.\n",
"\n",
"For compilation of the source, you will need F# 5.0 or later.  For runtime you\u0027ll need .NET 5.\n",
"\n",
"The project is hosted on [GitHub][gh] where you can [report issues][issues], fork the project and submit pull requests.\n",
